      <h2>Welcome to SwitchList!</h2>
      <p>Do you love your Nintendo Switch games? Well so do we! This website exists to aid users in finding just the right game. We allow users to search through the list of Switch games via a number of useful parameters. Want to find all the switch games with Nobuo Uematsu as composer? Well now you can! Eventually we want to add the ability for users to create their own profile and sort games (for instance, mark each game that the user owns, or set them into seperate containers like 'Jim's Games') We hope to add this extended functionality soon.</p>
